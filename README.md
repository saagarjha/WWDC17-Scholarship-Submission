# WWDC17 Scholarship Submission

Code for my submission to WWDC17, which ended up being accepted. In a nutshell, it simulates waves using the iOS AutoLayout engine and Grand Central Dispatch timers. This code was written in a rush and is on display here as it was submitted; as such it is poorly written and has numerous bugs. These are *intentional* and I'm not looking to work on this project any more.
